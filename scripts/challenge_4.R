# Next challenge! We thankfully have profit per job - but why is that good?

# We can't really know when these will come. What we can do is calculate total profit
# for these now, calculate the total resulting increase and distribute evenly through
# the year - neat right? Not exactly linear regression but works fine

# Firstly, shall we grab category name? This will make our lifes easier later

# We'll approach it this way: an x increase in customerTypeID will imply an mean increase of y in
# profit, according to mean profit for each category, for both cases. For jobs, we shall compute
# how much jobs there would be with that % increase, and each + job will imply in one mean increase:
# for client types, is fairly straightforward - + 2 type 10 clients will imply in 2 * the mean increase
# in profit.

# First, let's do jobs - since it's a less than 10 lines dataframe, let's keep it simple and manual:

cat_profit$forecastTotalJobs[4] <- round(cat_profit$totalJobs[4] * 1.08, 0)

# Just compute the difference between actual and forecasted and multiply by mean profit to get profit increase
cat_profit$forecastedProfitIncrease <- (cat_profit$forecastTotalJobs - cat_profit$totalJobs) * cat_profit$meanProfit # nolint

# Now for customer types
cust_type_profit$forecastTotalCustomer <- NA # nolint 

cust_type_profit$forecastTotalCustomer[1] <- cust_type_profit$totalCustomers[1] + 2
cust_type_profit$forecastTotalCustomer[3] <- cust_type_profit$totalCustomers[3] + 4

cust_type_profit$forecastedProfitIncrease <- (cust_type_profit$forecastTotalCustomer - cust_type_profit$totalCustomers) * cust_type_profit$meanProfit # nolint

# Done and done - now all we need to do is calculate total forecasted profit increase
cust_total_profit_inc <- sum(cust_type_profit$forecastedProfitIncrease, na.rm = TRUE)

# Forecasted monthly profit will be profit + total_profit_inc/12:

# The sum matches forecasted total profit! Before visualizing, melt it - it will be easier, trust me.
